# Active Todos - TUI Foundation Implementation

## Phase 1: TUI Foundation (Priority: P0 Critical)

### Project Setup & Structure
- [ ] Create `src/tui/` package structure with proper __init__.py files
- [ ] Set up Textual application skeleton with base App class
- [ ] Configure basic CSS styling system for consistent theming
- [ ] Remove unnecessary dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn, scikit-learn, numpy)

### Core Application Framework  
- [ ] Implement `CCMonitorApp` main application class with Textual framework
- [ ] Create main screen layout with three-panel structure (header, content, footer)
- [ ] Add global key bindings (quit='q', help='h', pause='p', filter='f')
- [ ] Implement graceful application startup and shutdown sequences

### Layout System Implementation
- [ ] Implement responsive three-panel layout (projects sidebar, live feed, status bar)
- [ ] Create ProjectsPanel widget for left sidebar (25% width, 20-40 char bounds)
- [ ] Create LiveFeedPanel widget for main content area (remaining width)
- [ ] Add Header widget with title and navigation (3 lines height)
- [ ] Add Footer widget with status and shortcuts (1 line height)

### Navigation & Interaction
- [ ] Implement Tab/arrow key navigation between panels with focus management
- [ ] Add visual focus indicators for active panels and components
- [ ] Create ESC key context navigation (return to previous context)
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcut help overlay (H key)

### Responsive Design & Terminal Handling
- [ ] Add terminal resize handling with dynamic panel sizing
- [ ] Implement minimum size constraints (80x24 terminal support)
- [ ] Create adaptive layout that prevents content cutoff or overlap
- [ ] Add scrolling support when content exceeds panel dimensions

### Visual Design & Styling
- [ ] Implement consistent color scheme (primary: #0066CC, secondary: #6C757D, etc.)
- [ ] Add message type colors (user: blue, assistant: green, system: yellow, tool: orange)
- [ ] Create professional border styles with rounded corners
- [ ] Add loading states and smooth transitions between UI states

### Error Handling & Compatibility
- [ ] Implement graceful startup failure handling with informative error messages
- [ ] Add terminal compatibility checks for feature support
- [ ] Create fallback modes for limited terminal capabilities
- [ ] Add comprehensive error logging for TUI-specific issues

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Write unit tests for all TUI components with >95% coverage
- [ ] Create integration tests for application lifecycle (startup/operation/shutdown)
- [ ] Add performance tests for startup time (<500ms) and memory usage (<10MB)
- [ ] Test cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- [ ] Validate keyboard shortcuts across different terminal emulators

### Integration & CLI Compatibility
- [ ] Integrate TUI mode with existing CLI structure and configuration
- [ ] Ensure `ccmonitor` command can launch TUI application
- [ ] Maintain compatibility with existing config system
- [ ] Add TUI usage examples to documentation

## Estimated Effort: 2 days (16 hours total)
- Day 1: Project setup, application framework, layout system, navigation (8 hours)
- Day 2: Responsive design, visual polish, error handling, testing (8 hours)

## Dependencies
- textual>=5.3.0 (already added)
- rich>=14.1.0 (already added)

## Success Criteria
- TUI application launches without errors
- Multi-panel layout renders correctly across terminal sizes (80x24 to 200x50)
- All keyboard navigation works intuitively
- Application handles terminal resize gracefully
- Memory usage stays under 10MB for basic UI
- UI renders in under 500ms on startup
