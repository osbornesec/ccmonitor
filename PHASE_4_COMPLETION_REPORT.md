- ✅ **Performance**: Load and stress testing
- ✅ **Concurrency**: Multi-threaded scenario testing

## 8. **Remaining Coverage Gaps (Expected)**

### **Acceptable Uncovered Areas**
- **CLI Config (58% uncovered)**: Complex configuration system - many edge cases are environment-specific
- **Utils modules**: Helper functions with extensive error handling paths
- **Widget implementations**: Some widgets pending in TUI development

### **Strategic Coverage Decisions**
