## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Begin with Phase 1 (Critical Blocking Issues)
```bash
# Start with the first task
cat fix/001_fix_sqlite_utils_version_constraint.md

# These tasks MUST be completed first
001_fix_sqlite_utils_version_constraint.md
002_verify_quality_tool_installation.md
003_setup_cicd_quality_pipeline.md
004_audit_all_exception_handlers.md
005_fix_blind_exception_db_commands.md
006_fix_blind_exception_data_ingestion.md
007_implement_secure_state_file_handling.md
008_apply_black_formatting.md
009_commit_formatting_fixes.md
```

### 2. Continue with Foundation Work (Phase 2)
```bash
# Type system and import fixes
010_install_missing_type_stubs.md
011_fix_pydantic_import_errors.md
012_fix_basemodel_subclass_errors.md
# ... and so on
```

### 3. Progress Through Remaining Phases
Each task builds on previous work and follows dependencies.

## üìä Task Dependencies

### Critical Path (Must Complete in Order)
1. **001** ‚Üí All Phase 1 tasks
2. **Phase 1 Complete** ‚Üí **010** ‚Üí All type system work  
3. **Phase 2 Complete** ‚Üí **026** ‚Üí All performance work
4. **Phase 3 Complete** ‚Üí **043** ‚Üí All API/feature work
5. **Phase 4 Complete** ‚Üí **062** ‚Üí All testing/documentation

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- Within phases, many tasks can run in parallel
- Different specialists can work simultaneously on their expertise areas
- See individual task dependencies for specific prerequisites

## üîß Usage Instructions

### Working with Individual Tasks

1. **Read the Task File**
   ```bash
   cat fix/001_fix_sqlite_utils_version_constraint.md
   ```

2. **Follow Implementation Steps**
   - Each task has numbered implementation steps
   - Follow validation commands to verify completion
   - Check acceptance criteria before marking complete

3. **Update Dependencies**
   - Mark task as complete when all criteria met
   - Enable dependent tasks to begin
   - Coordinate with other team members

### Progress Tracking

Create a simple tracking file:
```bash
# Track progress in a simple file
echo "PHASE 1 PROGRESS" > task_progress.txt
echo "001 - COMPLETE" >> task_progress.txt
echo "002 - IN_PROGRESS" >> task_progress.txt
echo "003 - PENDING" >> task_progress.txt
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Notes

### Must Complete in Order
- **Phase 1 tasks are blocking** - nothing else can proceed until complete
- **Dependencies must be respected** - check each task's dependency list
- **Quality gates must pass** - all validation commands must succeed

### Risk Management
- Each task includes risk assessment and mitigation
- Test thoroughly before moving to next task
- Maintain backup/rollback capability
- Escalate if any task exceeds 150% of estimated time

### Quality Standards
- Every task must pass all validation commands
- No shortcuts or partial implementations
- Document any deviations or issues discovered
- Maintain enterprise-grade quality throughout
