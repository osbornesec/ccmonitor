## 🎯 Path to 95% Coverage

Current: **77%** → Target: **95%** (18% gap remaining)

### Identified Gap Areas:
1. **CLI Error Handling** (5% potential): Configuration edge cases, file system errors
2. **TUI Widget Integration** (8% potential): Complex navigation, animation edge cases  
3. **Async Operations** (3% potential): Event loop edge cases, cancellation scenarios
4. **Integration Paths** (2% potential): Cross-component error propagation

### Implementation Strategy:
```bash
# Targeted coverage enhancement
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html:coverage_reports/detailed
# Review HTML report for specific uncovered lines
# Create targeted tests for identified gaps
```

## 🔧 Usage Instructions

### Fast Development Testing
```bash
# Quick tests (20 seconds)
uv run pytest -m "not slow"

# With coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing -m "not slow"
```

### Comprehensive Testing  
```bash
# All tests including slow ones
uv run pytest

# Full coverage analysis
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html:coverage_reports/html
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Optimized for CI/CD pipelines
uv run pytest -m "not slow" --cov=src --cov-fail-under=75 --junit-xml=results.xml
```
